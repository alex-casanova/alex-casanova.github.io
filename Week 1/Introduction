Hello! It's nice to meet you!

My name is Alex Casanova, and I've been in the Computer Science program at SNHU for just over a year. What an interesting journey it's been! I've worked for a few years in the IT space (after getting an IT degree through SNHU - consider me a fan!), and I chose to come back for an education in Computer Science, with a focus on Software Development. There have been challenges, but I've learned so much. Some examples of what I've learned are:

•	Effective development work and collaboration on large-scale software projects
•	Programming languages like Java, Python, HTML, CSS and JS
•	Software Development Automation through tools like Jenkins and GitHub

These valuable skills have me hopeful for a career change upon graduation. My end goal is to work for a Big Tech company as a Software Developer, building tools to improve people's online experiences. I can’t wait to make a strong effort throughout this course to make my portfolio stand out!
