4-1 Journal: Career Choice and Artifact Update
My career development has been an interesting journey over the last few years. I graduated from SNHU in 2019 with a Master’s degree in Information Technology, and was excited to move forward in my career as an IT technician. I have been working in the IT space ever since, and it has been a great experience for me. I’ve learned a lot about how businesses operate, both from an IT and Operations perspective.  Recently, I’ve begun to find some shortcomings in my knowledge in the IT space, specifically revolving around IT automation and software development. This was the motivation to pursue a degree in Computer Science, focusing on Software Development. This degree program has been an eye-opening experience, and I’m once again excited to make a career change. I’m hoping to leverage this degree into an opportunity in the Software Development space, specifically focusing on Big Data and Automation. After doing some research on the space, I find that there seems to be much more room for promotion and upward mobility than there is in IT. I’ve met a number of career IT Support Specialists, who have been vying for promotions for years with no luck. Meanwhile, I’ve been working in IT, seeing developers in my org work their way up from intern into more senior roles, including Sr. Developer, Program Manager, and Director of Software Development. I’ve found so much passion in the Software Development space from those I’ve worked around, and I’ve found a similar passion for myself in this program.
