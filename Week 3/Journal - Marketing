CS-499 3-1 Journal – Marketing with ePortfolios and Artifact update
Part One
	ePortfolios present a great opportunity for students and prospective employees to showcase their skills and projects to employers. By showing examples of what they’ve worked on in the past, ePortfolio users can prove that they’ve contributed valuable work to a project, whether on their own, or as part of a team. This allows employers to make better decisions on who to select for roles, where the experience displayed is similar to the experience they are searching for in a candidate. 
	While ePortfolios are a valuable tool, they present risks to their users as well. The first of these challenges is the concept of publishing your work in a front-facing setting. This makes code available to be seen by other people, which can be exploited. Copying code from portfolios into other projects without the permission of the poster is a serious problem, as developers spend hard work developing the relevant software. However, limiting the risk of this can be done by segmenting code into smaller pieces, and only highlighting parts of a whole project as an ePortfolio. It is also important to carefully consider who the ePortfolio is made available to. As an example, it is likely worth hiding the contents of an ePortfolio from anyone except those making relevant hiring decisions. 
Part Two
•	Software design/engineering – Stage 2
•	The Python re-write is ongoing, and is in stage 2. The existing functionality has been re-written into Python, but many features have yet to be added as part of the web interface and database sections of the project.
•	Algorithms and data structures – Stage 2
•	I have changed out the Singleton classes in my code for constructors of database records.
•	Databases – Stage 2
•	The database has not yet been constructed. Once it has, I will implement it and ensure functionality.
